# Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.




# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.





# Problem 3: Largest prime factor

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

## Answer

I solved it with [Fermat's factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_factorization_method).



# Problem 4: Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 * 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.




# Problem 5: Smallest multiple


2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

## Answer

Since 20 is a small number, scanning from 1~20 will be enough

```
2*3*5*7*2*2*3*11*13*2*17*19 = 232792560
```

To solve it programmatically, a generic algorithm is

```
product = 1

for i in 2 to N:
    is product divisible by i? 
        if yes -> continue
        if not -> product = least_common_multiple(i, product) 

return product
```

The "overview" pdf doc has another algorithm which is better than the one above. The idea is that every integer can be written as the product of prime number with certain power. The problem become to find the largest power of each prime number so that p^n <= 20. In this case, it becomes

```
2^4 * 3^2 * 5* 7 * 11 * 13* 17 *19
```

For this algorithm to work, the key is to find the series of prime numbers smaller than N (here N=20). 


# Problem 6: Sum square difference


The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

```
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
```

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

```
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
```

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


## Answer

A straightforward solution is by adding up the cross terms. 

The "overview" pdf doc gives the mathematical formulas of sum of squares and square of sum, thus avoiding hogging the CPU if N is large. 



# Problem 7: 10001st prime

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10001st prime number?


## Answer

See my solution in `main.py`. The "overview" pdf doc actually uses a very similar idea. 


# Problem 8: Largest product in a series

Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?




# Problem 9: Special Pythagorean triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

```
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

For example, `3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2`.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.


## Answer

Reduce equations

```
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2
```

to 

```
1000^2 - 2000a - 2000b + 2ab = 0
```

which further leads to 


```
a = (500000 - 1000b) / (1000 -b)
```

And the goal is to solve the above equations with conditions

* a, b are both positive integers
* a, b are both smaller than 1000

The rest is to scan b from 1 to 999 and find the match with a simple script. 

See 'overview' pdf doc for another approach to this problem (parametrization of Pythagorean triplet). 

# Problem 10: Summation of primes


The sum of the primes below 10 is

```
2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
```

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

## Answer

It is natural to borrow the solution from Problem 7 ("10001st prime") for the purpose of finding prime numbers below an upper bound. But the upper bound of 2 million makes the program run slow. See `main.py` for the implementation. 

However, "overview" pdf doc gives a faster (and ancient) algorithm "[sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)" to find the prime numbers below a limit. The idea is to incrementally identify prime numbers starting from 2 by eliminating multiples of the already discovered prime numbers from the bag, given the fact that the next composite number can be written in form of the multiples of products of a subset of previously discovered prime numbers. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N), but takes less time to compute. 

Follow-up question: compare the time and space complexities of those two approaches. 

# Problem 11: Largest product in a grid


In the 20×20 grid below, four numbers along a diagonal line have been marked in red.


![20 by 20 grid](http://i.imgur.com/W07dWGW.png)


The product of these numbers is 26 × 63 × 78 × 14 = 1788696.

What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20×20 grid?


## Answer

This is just basic matrix manipulation. Not a hard problem, but easy to make mistakes. 



# Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number


The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

```
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
```

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

```
 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
```

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?


## Answer:

My initial algorithm: 

* Obvious the k-th triangle number can be written as `k*(k+1)/2`. 

* If factorize the triangle number into the product of prime numbers, it can be written in form of 

```
N = a1^p1 * a2^p2 * a3^p3 ...
```

which can be done with the Fermat's factorization routine in Problem 3. 

So the number of possible divisors is 

```
1 + (p1 + p2 + p3 + ...) + (p1*p2 + p1*p3 + ... + p2*p3 + p2*p4 + ...)
+ (p1*p2*p3 + p1*p2*p4 + ...) + ...
```

And the itertools module in Python can be used to iterate through all combinations. 

The "overview" doc actually showed very similar thinking, but pointing out that the 2nd step is simply

```
(1+p1) * (1+p2) * (1+p3) ....
```

which makes my approach look dumb...

## Answer:

To avoid integer overflow, I convert each integer into a list of numbers, and define a function to do the addition of two number lists. 


# Problem 14: Longest Collatz sequence

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

```
n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
```

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

```
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
```

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.


## Answer

Solutions 

1. Calculate on each number between 1 and 1 million in a brute-force way. 

2. Based on Solution 1 above, but using a hash table to cache all previously calculated Collatz numbers. 


# Problem 15: Lattice paths

Starting in the top left corner of a 2\*2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

![lattice paths](http://i.imgur.com/PUl2FZc.gif)

How many such routes are there through a 20\*20 grid?


## Answer

Two solutions are provided in `main.py`: 

* A natural thinking will be using dynamic programming with the formula

```
path_num[i][j] = path_num[i-1][j] + path_num[i][j-1]
```

It works for small lattice, but quickly fails as lattice dimension goes larger if there is no cached value among recursive calls.

* An improved iterative solution is to use a matrix in which the value of an element is the number of paths going from the origin (0,0) to this point. After initializing the first row and first columns as 1's, the rest of matrix elements can be calculated quickly according to the formula above. The answer will be the value of the lower right corner element of the matrix. Size of 20 is done in a blink. 

* The "overview" pdf also gives three solutions with first two almost identical to those given above. The third is more of a mathematical approach using combinational math which only has O(N) time complexity. 


# Problem 16: Power digit sum

2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?


## Answer

The idea is to convert an integer to a list and define the multiplication operation to avoid large integer overflow. 


# Problem 17: Number letter counts

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are `3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19` letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

## Answer

Really nothing fancy. Just be very careful about different situations.


# Problem 18: Maximum path sum I

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

![triangle 1](http://i.imgur.com/OzU9Gca.png)

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

![triangle 2](http://i.imgur.com/IMsTlAm.png)

NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)


## Answer

A typical thinking is to convert this triangle to a graph, and do a simple depth-first search (DFS). See `main.py` for details.  



# Problem 19: Counting Sundays

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

* 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
* Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty-nine.

* A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
