# Highly divisible triangular number


The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

```
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
```

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

```
 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
```

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?


## Answer:

My initial algorithm: 

* Obvious the k-th triangle number can be written as `k*(k+1)/2`. 

* If factorize the triangle number into the product of prime numbers, it can be written in form of 

```
N = a1^p1 * a2^p2 * a3^p3 ...
```

which can be done with the Fermat's factorization routine in Problem 3. 

So the number of possible divisors is 

```
1 + (p1 + p2 + p3 + ...) + (p1*p2 + p1*p3 + ... + p2*p3 + p2*p4 + ...)
+ (p1*p2*p3 + p1*p2*p4 + ...) + ...
```

And the itertools module in Python can be used to iterate through all combinations. 

The "overview" doc actually showed very similar thinking, but pointing out that the 2nd step is simply

```
(1+p1) * (1+p2) * (1+p3) ....
```

which makes my approach look dumb...
